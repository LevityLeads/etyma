S U N N Y

From Old English "sunne", through Proto-Germanic *sunnōn, all the way back to Proto-Indo-European *sóh₂wl̥.

The same ancient root that gave us the Latin "sōl", Greek "hḗlios", and Sanskrit "sūrya". Five thousand years of language, sitting quietly in two syllables.

/ˈsʌn.i/
Trochee (DA-da). A voiceless alveolar fricative opening into a warm, open vowel. Bright. Optimistic. Exactly what it sounds like.

Morphemes: sun (the star) + -y (having the quality of)
= radiant ☀️
