# Post 02 — LUNA

## Caption

L U N A

From Latin "lūna", from Proto-Italic *louksnā, from Proto-Indo-European *lewk, meaning "light" or "brightness".

The same root gave us "luminous", "lucid", "illuminate", and "Lucifer" (the light-bringer). Your name is older than Rome.

/ˈluː.nə/
Two syllables. A lateral approximant flowing into a long vowel. Smooth, soft, nocturnal. The sound itself feels like moonlight.

Morphemes: lūna (moon, single morpheme)
Original word class: noun. The moon itself, not a description of it. Direct. Elemental.

Cognates: French "lune", Italian "luna", Spanish "luna", Romanian "lună". In every Romance language, your name means the same thing.

Every name is a living fossil. This is Word Anatomy.
