A L E X A N D E R

From Ancient Greek "Aléxandros" (Ἀλέξανδρος). Two morphemes: "aléxein" (to defend) + "anḗr" (man).

Literal meaning: defender of men.

Carried by Alexander the Great, who spread it from Macedonia to India. The name then fractured across every language it touched: Alessandro (Italian), Alejandro (Spanish), Iskander (Arabic/Persian), Alasdair (Scottish Gaelic), Oleksandr (Ukrainian).

/ˌæl.ɪɡˈzæn.dər/
Four syllables. A dactylic rhythm. The voiced velar plosive /ɡ/ at the centre gives it weight. This is not a soft name. It was built to command.

One name. Thirty languages. Two thousand years. Still the most popular boy's name in multiple countries.

Every name is a living fossil. This is Word Anatomy.
